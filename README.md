# SQL Practice Problems
SQL Practice Problems 57 beginning, intermediate and advanced challenges for you to solve using a "learn-by-doing" approach is a book by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik.

The book uses Mircosoft SQL Server database and the practice dataset Northwind.

My SQL skills are at the beginner lever, but I will attempt to answer all problems before seeking the answers.

I will quote my answers vs the book answers with a short text explaining the difference if any, how close I got to the answer and what I learned from that problem.

Different databases use different functions. 
SQL server do not use LIMIT. 
There are different ways to create an alias: as, =, or just putting the alias next to the column name.
All joins do not work on all databases.
When using JOINs the columns used in the ON clause may not have the same name, for example, ON Orders.ShipVia = Shippers.ShipperID .
