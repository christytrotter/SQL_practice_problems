# SQL Practice Problems
SQL Practice Problems 57 beginning, intermediate and advanced challenges for you to solve using a "learn-by-doing" approach is a book by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik.

The book uses Mircosoft SQL Server database and the practice dataset Northwind.

My SQL skills are at the beginner lever, but I will attempt to answer all problems before seeking the answers.

I will quote my answers vs the book answers with a short text explaining the difference if any, how close I got to the answer and what I learned from that problem.

When using JOINs the columns used in the ON clause may not have the same name, for example, ON Orders.ShipVia = Shippers.ShipperID .
