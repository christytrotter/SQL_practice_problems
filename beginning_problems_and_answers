1. Which shippers do we have?
We have a table called Shippers. Return all the fields from all the shippers

  Answer
    SELECT *
    FROM Shippers;

2. Certain fields from Categories
In the Categories table, selecting all the fields using this SQL: Select * from Categories …will return 4 columns. We only want to see two columns, CategoryName and Description.

  Answer
    SELECT CategoryName, Description
    FROM Categories;

3. Sales Representatives
We’d like to see just the FirstName, LastName, and HireDate of all the employees with the Title of Sales Representative. Write a SQL statement that returns only those employees.

  Answer
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Title = 'Sales Representative';

4. Sales Representatives in the United States
Now we’d like to see the same columns as above, but only for those employees that both have the title of Sales Representative, and also are in the United States.

  Answer
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Title = 'Sales Representative' and Country = 'USA';

5. Orders placed by specific EmployeeID
  Show all the orders placed by a specific employee. The EmployeeID for this Employee (Steven Buchanan) is 5.

  Answer
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders
    WHERE EmployeeID = 5;

      Book Answer: The expected results uses OrderID and OrderDate but that wasn't specified in the problem.
        SELECT OrderID, OrderDate
        FROM Orders
        WHERE EmployeeID = 5;

6. Suppliers and ContactTitles
In the Suppliers table, show the SupplierID, ContactName, and ContactTitle for those Suppliers whose ContactTitle is not Marketing Manager.

  Answer
    SELECT SupplierID, ContactName, ContactTitle
    FROM Suppliers
    WHERE ContactTitle != 'Markering Manager';
    
      Book Answer: The book use <> but we get the same result. 
      
7. Products with “queso” in ProductName
In the products table, we’d like to see the ProductID and ProductName for those products where the ProductName includes the string “queso”.

8. Orders shipping to France or Belgium
Looking at the Orders table, there’s a field called ShipCountry. Write a query that shows the OrderID, CustomerID, and ShipCountry for the orders where the ShipCountry is either France or Belgium.

9. Orders shipping to any country in Latin America
Now, instead of just wanting to return all the orders from France of Belgium, we want to show all the orders from any Latin American country. But we don’t have a list of Latin American countries in a
table in the Northwind database. So, we’re going to just use this list of Latin American countries that happen to be in the Orders table: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela
It doesn’t make sense to use multiple Or statements
anymore, it would get too convoluted. Use the In
statement.

10. Employees, in order of age
For all the employees in the Employees table, show the FirstName, LastName, Title, and BirthDate. Order the results by BirthDate, so we have the oldest employees first.

11. Showing only the Date with a DateTime field
In the output of the query above, showing the Employees in order of BirthDate, we see the time of the BirthDate field, which we don’t want. Show only the date portion of the BirthDate field.

12. Employees full name
Show the FirstName and LastName columns from the Employees table, and then create a new column called FullName, showing FirstName and LastName joined together in one column, with a space inbetween.

13. OrderDetails amount per line item
In the OrderDetails table, we have the fields UnitPrice and Quantity. Create a new field, TotalPrice, that multiplies these two together. We’ll ignore the Discount field for now.
In addition, show the OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice, and Quantity. Order by OrderID and ProductID.

14. How many customers?
How many customers do we have in the Customers table? Show one value only, and don’t rely on getting the recordcount at the end of a resultset.

15. When was the first order?
Show the date of the first order ever made in the Orders table.

16. Countries where there are customers
Show a list of countries where the Northwind company has customers.

17. Contact titles for customers
Show a list of all the different values in the Customers table for ContactTitles. Also include a count for each ContactTitle.
This is similar in concept to the previous question “Countries where there are customers”, except we now want a count for each ContactTitle.

18. Products with associated supplier names
We’d like to show, for each product, the associated Supplier. Show the ProductID, ProductName, and the CompanyName of the Supplier. Sort by ProductID.
This question will introduce what may be a new concept, the Join clause in SQL. The Join clause is used to join two or more relational database tables
together in a logical way. Here’s a data model of the relationship between Products and Suppliers.

19. Orders and the Shipper that was used
We’d like to show a list of the Orders that were made, including the Shipper that was used. Show the OrderID, OrderDate (date only), and CompanyName
of the Shipper, and sort by OrderID. In order to not show all the orders (there’s more than 800), show only those rows with an OrderID of less than 10300.
